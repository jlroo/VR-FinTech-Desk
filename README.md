# Periodic Table of the Elements
Periodic Table of the Elements is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It demonstrates how to use **[Mixed Reality Toolkit(MRTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens and Immersive headsets. In this project, you can find the examples of:
- Use MRTK's **[Input System](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Overview.html)**
- Layout an array of objects in 3D space with various surface types using **MRTK's [Object Collection](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_ObjectCollection.html)**. 
- Create objects that respond to the standard inputs using **MRTK's [Interactable](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_Interactable.html)**. 
- **MRTK [Button](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_Button.html)**
- **MRTK [Manipulation Handler](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_ManipulationHandler.html)**
- Loading and parsing local JSON file data using Unity's JsonUtility

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.

Lunar Module is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs, it is a spiritual sequel to the 1979 Atari classic, *Lunar Lander*. This sample app will demonstrate how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience.
